                  ORION QUESTS - READ ME
==============================================================

Auto-complete Discord quests. Works with every type:
- Video (watch a trailer)
- Game (play X minutes)
- Stream (share your screen)
- Activity (be in a call with an activity)
- Achievement (in-game milestone) <- the hard one, already solved


==============================================================
                    QUICK INSTALL
==============================================================

1) INSTALL VENCORD (once, skip if you already have it)
   - Open your browser
   - Go to: https://vencord.dev/download
   - Download the Windows installer
   - Run it and click "Install"
   - Let it restart Discord if it asks

2) INSTALL ORIONQUESTS
   - DOUBLE-CLICK "INSTALL.cmd" (included in this zip)
   - Wait for it to finish (a black window opens)
   - It handles everything: closes Discord, copies the files,
     reopens Discord

3) ENABLE THE PLUGIN IN DISCORD
   - In Discord, open Settings (the gear at the bottom)
   - Scroll to the "Vencord" section (left menu)
   - Click "Plugins"
   - Search for "OrionQuests"
   - Turn the toggle on (blue button)
   - If a "Restart" or "Reload" button shows up, click it


==============================================================
                       HOW TO USE
==============================================================

In any Discord channel, type:

  /orion start    -- start auto-completing all quests
  /orion stop     -- stop
  /orion status   -- see which quests it's working on

The browser console (Ctrl+Shift+I in Discord) shows the
detailed log if you want to follow along.


==============================================================
                  COMMON PROBLEMS
==============================================================

"The installer told me to install Vencord first"
  Do step 1 of QUICK INSTALL above, then run INSTALL.cmd again.

"OrionQuests doesn't show up in the Plugins list"
  Make sure you fully closed Discord FROM THE SYSTEM TRAY
  (right-click the icon near the clock -> Quit Discord).
  Just closing the window isn't enough.

"The plugin is on but /orion start does nothing"
  Press Ctrl+R in Discord to reload.

"Activity quest won't complete, error 50165"
  You need to age-verify on Discord for that specific
  Activity. Go to User Settings -> Privacy & Safety ->
  and verify your age.

"After updating Vencord the plugin disappeared"
  The official Vencord installer overwrote our files.
  Just run INSTALL.cmd again.

"Vencord says it can't check for updates / won't update"
  That's expected. This bundle ships a build with the auto-updater
  turned off, so Vencord stays frozen on the bundled version and
  won't try (and fail) to update itself. It is NOT broken. See
  "UPDATING AND UNDOING" below if you want updates back.


==============================================================
              UPDATING AND UNDOING
==============================================================

This bundle installs a Vencord build with auto-update turned OFF,
so your Vencord stays frozen on the version that shipped here. That
is intentional: it is what stops the "can't check for updates" error
you would otherwise get. The tradeoff is Vencord won't self-update
while this is installed.

To update Vencord (this removes the plugin, then re-adds it):
  1. Reinstall the official Vencord from https://vencord.dev/download
     (this restores a normal, self-updating Vencord)
  2. Run INSTALL.cmd again to put the plugin back

To fully undo and get a clean, updatable Vencord back:
  - Run the official Vencord installer and pick "Repair", OR
  - Restore the "dist.orion-backup" folder that INSTALL.cmd saved
    inside %APPDATA%\Vencord (copy it back over "dist")

Want Vencord to KEEP auto-updating instead of freezing? Use the
"auto-update edition" (orion-devbuild-installer) from the same release.
It's heavier (builds Vencord from source, a few hundred MB) but the
plugin rides along through every Vencord update.

                  IMPORTANT WARNINGS
==============================================================

* Using mods on Discord violates the Terms of Service. The
  ban risk is YOURS. There are reports of warnings after
  April 2026, and enforcement can hit the whole account.

* The Achievement bypass authorizes the quest's app on your
  account via OAuth to report progress, then revokes it right
  after. If that worries you, skip it on your main account.

* The plugin only completes quests YOU already have on your
  account. It can't pull rewards that weren't offered to you.

* Project source: github.com/nyxxbit/discord-quest-completer
