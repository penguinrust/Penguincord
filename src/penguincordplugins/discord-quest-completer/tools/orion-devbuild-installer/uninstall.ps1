  Uninstall the Orion Quests "auto-update edition".

  Robust because the friend may have already deleted the OrionVencord clone (which would
  brick Discord, since its app.asar stub require()s the clone's patcher.js). So we do NOT
  depend on the clone: we restore Discord's original app.asar directly, for every flavor,
  but only where the stub actually points at OUR OrionVencord install.
