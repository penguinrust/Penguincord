ORION QUESTS - VENCORD AUTO-UPDATE EDITION
===========================================

This is the "heavier but correct" installer. Use it if you want Vencord to
keep auto-updating while the OrionQuests plugin is installed.

How it differs from the simple bundle (orion-vencord-bundle):
  - The simple bundle copies a prebuilt Vencord over yours. Tiny and instant,
    but it FREEZES your Vencord version (auto-update is turned off).
  - This edition builds Vencord from source with the plugin baked in, as a real
    git clone. Vencord's updater keeps working: it pulls updates and rebuilds,
    and the plugin is recompiled back in every time. Auto-update stays alive.


------------------------------------------------------------
WHAT TO EXPECT (read this so you don't panic)
------------------------------------------------------------
  - It takes about 5 to 15 minutes and downloads roughly 300 MB.
  - It will sit on "Installing dependencies" with fast scrolling text for a
    while. THAT IS NORMAL. Do NOT close the window - closing it mid-way leaves
    a half-finished install.
  - Needs Node.js 22+ and Git. If they're missing, the installer permanently
    installs them system-wide via winget, and each shows its own "Do you want
    to allow changes?" (UAC) box - click Yes.


------------------------------------------------------------
INSTALL
------------------------------------------------------------
  1. Double-click INSTALL-autoupdate.cmd
  2. If it installs Node.js / Git, allow the UAC prompts (Yes). If it asks you
     to close and re-run afterwards, do that.
  3. When it patches Discord, Windows may show a full-screen blue box:
     "Windows protected your PC". Click "More info", then "Run anyway".
     This is Vencord's own installer, freshly downloaded from GitHub; Windows
     flags it only because it's new/unsigned. If it ever names a publisher
     other than Vencord, stop.
  4. When it finishes, Discord reopens. Go to Settings -> Plugins, search
     OrionQuests, and enable it. For achievement quests, also enable the
     "achievementBypass" toggle (off by default).


------------------------------------------------------------
IMPORTANT
------------------------------------------------------------
  - It installs into:  %LOCALAPPDATA%\OrionVencord
    (usually C:\Users\<you>\AppData\Local\OrionVencord)
    DO NOT move or delete that folder. Discord loads Vencord from it. If you
    delete it while it's installed, Discord won't start (see RECOVERY below).

  - Vencord updates itself normally after this (Settings -> Vencord -> Updater).
    If an update ever says "Build failed", run UPDATE.cmd from this folder - it
    does the full rebuild the in-app updater can't.

  - WHEN DISCORD ITSELF UPDATES, Vencord normally carries the patch over on its
    own: it notices the new version as Discord is closing and re-applies itself.
    That only works if Discord shuts down properly, so if Discord was force-closed
    (Task Manager, a crash, or the PC cutting out) the patch can be left behind in
    the old version's folder and the plugin will be gone on next launch. Nothing is
    broken and nothing is lost - just double-click INSTALL-autoupdate.cmd again and
    it re-patches the new version in seconds, reusing everything already downloaded.


------------------------------------------------------------
UNINSTALL
------------------------------------------------------------
  - Double-click UNINSTALL.cmd. It restores Discord to normal, then you can
    delete the OrionVencord folder. (Node.js and Git stay installed; UNINSTALL
    tells you how to remove those too if you want.)


------------------------------------------------------------
RECOVERY (if something goes wrong)
------------------------------------------------------------
  - If Discord won't open: go to
    %LOCALAPPDATA%\Discord\app-<version>\resources
    delete "app.asar", and rename "_app.asar" to "app.asar".
    Discord will open normally again (without the plugin). Then you can re-run
    INSTALL-autoupdate.cmd if you want it back.
  - If an update says "Build failed": run UPDATE.cmd.
  - If the OrionVencord folder got into a weird state: delete it and re-run
    INSTALL-autoupdate.cmd.
  - Last resort: run the official Vencord installer (vencord.dev/download) and
    pick Uninstall or Repair.
